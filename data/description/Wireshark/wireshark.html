<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Wireshark</strong> is a GUI network protocol analyzer.  It lets you
interactively browse packet data from a live network or from a
previously saved capture file.  <strong>Wireshark</strong>'s native capture file
formats are <strong>pcapng</strong> format and <strong>pcap</strong> format; it can read and write
both formats..  <strong>pcap</strong> format is also the format used by <strong>tcpdump</strong> and
various other tools; <strong>tcpdump</strong>, when using newer versions of the
<strong>libpcap</strong> library, can also read some pcapng files, and, on newer
versions of macOS, can read all pcapng files and can write them as well.</p>

<p><strong>Wireshark</strong> can also read / import the following file formats:</p>

<p>There is no need to tell <strong>Wireshark</strong> what type of
file you are reading; it will determine the file type by itself.
<strong>Wireshark</strong> is also capable of reading any of these file formats if they
are compressed using gzip, LZ4, or Zstandard, if compiled with the
appropriate support.  <strong>Wireshark</strong> recognizes this directly from the file;
the '.gz' or other extension is not required for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like other protocol analyzers, <strong>Wireshark</strong>'s main window shows 3 views
of a packet.  It shows a summary line, briefly describing what the
packet is.  A packet details display is shown, allowing you to drill
down to exact protocol or field that you interested in.  Finally, a hex
dump shows you exactly what the packet looks like when it goes over the
wire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, <strong>Wireshark</strong> has some features that make it unique.  It can
assemble all the packets in a TCP conversation and show you the ASCII
(or EBCDIC, or hex) data in that conversation.  Display filters in
<strong>Wireshark</strong> are very powerful; more fields are filterable in <strong>Wireshark</strong>
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax you can use to create
your filters is richer.  As <strong>Wireshark</strong> progresses, expect more and more
protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  The capture filter
syntax follows the rules of the pcap library.  This syntax is different
from the display filter syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present, <strong>Wireshark</strong> will compile, but will
be unable to read compressed files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pathname of a capture file to be read can be specified with the
<strong>-r</strong> option or can be specified as a command-line argument.</p>

where <em>test</em> is one of:</p>

2 TB, although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI before then if
the number of packets exceeds 2<sup>31</sup> (2147483648).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The created filenames are based on the filename given with the <strong>-w</strong> flag,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <em>files</em> option it&#8217;s also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point <strong>Wireshark</strong> will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the <em>files</em> option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).</p>

<p><strong>files</strong>:<em>value</em> begin again with the first file after <em>value</em> number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The <strong>files</strong> criterion
requires one of the other criteria to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each <strong>-b</strong>
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criteria, each must be
preceded by the <strong>-b</strong> option.</p>

<p>On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and
AIX, the global plugin directory is <em>lib/wireshark/plugins/</em> (on
some systems substitute <em>lib64</em> for <em>lib</em>) under the main installation
directory (for example, <em>/usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/</em>). The personal
plugin directory is <em>$HOME/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins</em>.</p>

<p>On macOS, if Wireshark is installed as an application bundle, the global plugin
folder is instead <em>%APPDIR%/Contents/PlugIns/wireshark</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Windows, the global plugin folder is <em>plugins/</em> under the main
installation directory (for example, <em>C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\</em>).
The personal plugin folder is <em>%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins</em> (or, if
%APPDATA% isn&#8217;t defined, <em>%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Wireshark\plugins</em>).</p>

<p>Lua plugins are stored in the plugin folders;
compiled plugins are stored in subfolders of the plugin folders, with
the subfolder name being the Wireshark minor version number (X.Y). There is
another hierarchical level for each Wireshark plugin type (libwireshark,
libwiretap and codecs).  For example, the location for a libwireshark plugin
<em>foo.so</em> (<em>foo.dll</em> on Windows) would be <em>PLUGINDIR/X.Y/epan</em>

<p>This environment variable overrides the location of personal
configuration files.  On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, it defaults to <em>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</em>
(or, if that directory doesn&#8217;t exist but <em>$HOME/.wireshark</em> does

<em>$HOME/.config/wireshark</em>.  On Windows, it defaults to

</div>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the
specified allocator backend for <strong>all</strong> allocations, regardless of which
backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See <em>README.wmem</em> in the source distribution for
details.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be
loaded from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather
than from the standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in
question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible
systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_EXTCAP_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various extcap programs and scripts
to be run from a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no
effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various plugins to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the ERF format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable controls the number of IPFIX records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the IPFIX format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <strong>Wireshark</strong> will call abort(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  abort(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running <strong>Wireshark</strong> in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <strong>Wireshark</strong> will call abort(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
abort(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
<strong>Wireshark</strong> in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Cause <strong>Wireshark</strong> to exit after the end of the capture session.  This
doesn&#8217;t automatically start a capture; you must still use <strong>-k</strong> to do
that.  You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g.  <strong>-c</strong> or <strong>-a
duration:&#8230;&#8203;</strong>.  This means that you will not be able to see the results
of the capture after it stops; it&#8217;s primarily useful for testing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_LEVEL</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable controls the verbosity of diagnostic messages to
the console. From less verbose to most verbose levels can be <code>critical</code>,
<code>warning</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>debug</code> or <code>noisy</code>. Levels above the
current level are also active. Levels <code>critical</code> and <code>error</code> are always
active.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_FATAL</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the fatal log level. Fatal log levels cause the program to abort.
This level can be set to <code>Error</code>, <code>critical</code> or <code>warning</code>. <code>Error</code> is
always fatal and is the default.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_DOMAINS</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable selects which log domains are active. The filter is
given as a case-insensitive comma separated list. If set only the included
domains will be enabled. The default domain is always considered to be enabled.
Domain filter lists can be preceded by '!' to invert the sense of the match.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_DEBUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>List of domains with <code>debug</code> log level. This sets the level of the provided
log domains and takes precedence over the active domains filter. If preceded
by '!' this disables the <code>debug</code> level instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_NOISY</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as above but for <code>noisy</code> log level instead.</p>
